      <h2>The Great Wall of China</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Wall was continuously built from the 3rd century BC to the 17th century AD on the northern border
         of the country as the great military defence project of successive Chinese Empires, with a total length of 
         more than 20,000 kilometers.The Great Wall is reputed as one of the seven construction wonders in the world 
         not only for its long history, but its massive construction size, and its unique architectural style as well. 
         A great army of manpower, composed of soldiers, prisoners, and local people, built the wall.
